# myLib
TypeScript Framework


You just need myLib.d.ts and myLib.js to use it 
/CSS/myLib.css
/CSS/Colors.css
/CSS/Icons.css
/CSS/Fonts/Material-icons/ 
are recomended but not mandatory 
/CSS/Icons.css will not work withoout the files from /CSS/Fonts/Material-icons/ 

the rest of the files are just the source code. 

Best to download the entire folder and open it with VSCode
