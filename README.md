# myLib
TypeScript Framework


You just need myLib.d.ts and myLib.js to use it 
/CSS/myLib.css
/CSS/Colors.css
/CSS/Icons.css
/CSS/Fonts/Material-icons/ 
are recomended but not mandatory 
/CSS/Icons.css will not work withoout the files from /CSS/Fonts/Material-icons/ 

the rest of the files are just the source code. 

Best to download the entire folder and open it with VSCode

I created this framework as easy to use solution with no dependacies, it is not perfect but it is usable for most coomon tasks nedded 

anyone needs help with it just ask :)
